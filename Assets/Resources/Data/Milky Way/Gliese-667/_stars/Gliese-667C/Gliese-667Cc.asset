  Name: Gliese-667Cc
  Details: "<b>Gliese 667 Cc</b> (also known as <b>GJ 667Cc</b>, <b>HR 6426Cc</b>,
    or <b>HD 156384Cc</b>) is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of
    the red dwarf star Gliese 667 C, which is a member of the Gliese 667 triple star
    system, approximately 23.62 light-years (7.24 parsecs; 223.5 trillion kilometres)
    away in the constellation of Scorpius. The exoplanet was found by using the radial
    velocity method, from radial-velocity measurements via observation of Doppler
    shifts in the spectrum of the planet's parent star.  Gliese 667 Cc is a super-Earth,
    an exoplanet with a mass and radius greater than that of Earth, but smaller than
    that of the giant planets Uranus and Neptune. It is heavier than Earth with a
    minimum mass of about 3.7 Earth masses. The equilibrium temperature of Gliese
    667 Cc is estimated to be 277.4 K (4.3 \xB0C; 39.6 \xB0F). It is expected to
    have a radius of around 1.5 REarth, dependent upon its composition."
