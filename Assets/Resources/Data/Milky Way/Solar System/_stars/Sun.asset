  StarDescription: The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
    nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
    reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet
    light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy
    for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles),
    or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and
    it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
