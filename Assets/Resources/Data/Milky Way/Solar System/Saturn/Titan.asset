  Name: Titan
  Details: Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest natural satellite
    in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere.<br><br>Titan
    is the sixth gravitationally rounded moon from Saturn. Frequently described as
    a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's moon and 80% more massive.
    It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede,
    and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in
    1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon
    of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the
    four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From
    Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4
    times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.
