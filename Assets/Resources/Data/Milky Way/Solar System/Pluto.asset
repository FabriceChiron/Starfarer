  Name: Pluto
  Details: Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered
    to be the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned
    following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt.
    In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive
    than Pluto, was discovered. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU)
    to define the term \"planet\" formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly.
    That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.
