  Name: Ganymede
  Details: Ganymede (Jupiter III) is the largest and most massive moon of Jupiter
    and in the Solar System. The ninth largest object in the Solar System, it is
    the largest without a substantial atmosphere. It has a diameter of 5,268 km (3,273
    mi) and is 8% larger than the planet Mercury, although only 45% as massive. Possessing
    a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body
    in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field. It is
    the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting
    another planet, and the seventh satellite outward from Jupiter, Ganymede orbits
    Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons
    Europa and Io, respectively.
